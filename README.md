**Please refesh the main page after login as it has an issue that needs to be fixed in case you want to see what task has been created**

**Why did you not created Features Structure?**
The Application is small and handy and I was already late to deliver

**Why did you not create Tests?**
Never worked on it before Happy to learn and apply it if I got extension to do it.

**Why did not use any frontend common solution architecture?**
As Backend Focused Engineer the N-Tier Architecture is closer to my mind/heart so splitting the application in Views/Models/Services is a simple stright way for a small application

**Why did you not Redux?**
I was very interested to try the fetch as it preduces less code and more flat structure

**what did you do for the mobile view?**
I did a quick and dirty solution that will remove the columns based on the screen size. better solutions will take longer time.

**CSS doesn't look very good!**
I don't really have the artistic skills so I rely on the UX designer to tell me what to do.
